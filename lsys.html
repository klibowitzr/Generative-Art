            <p> L-systems are cool, it's as simple as that. Drawing (and animating them STEP BY STEP) is a little bit more complex however.
                L-systems are rendered using a turtle graphics system (weird name, I'll explain). Imagine you're a turtle, and you're reading a set of instructions like "go straight ten feet, turn left, go straight another ten feet, turn right..."
                you get the idea. But, on top of aimlessly following these weird directions, you also have a giant marker (pretend it can draw on the earth's surface). So, as you're moving along, you're dragging your marker, leaving a trail behind
                (unless you're specifically told <em> not </em> to drag your marker, then you just move). That is what a turtle graphics system is, except we simulate it with a computer. </p>

            <p> Now that I've explained turtle graphics to you, I can explain L-systems. L-systems (short for Lindenmayer systems) were originally developed for modeling plants, but they have other uses too. In L-systems we begin with an initial
                rule, the axiom, and we give the system a set of rules. These rules say, "okay, when you see an <q>F</q>, replace it with <q> F[+F]F[-F]F </q> for example, and you can have more than one rule. In instances where we use letters that
                are not in our defined grammar, they are simply kept in the string (their sole use is just for string replacement patterns). We then give it a number of iterations to perform (or we step through it one iteration at a time), and each
                iteration it goes through and does the replacements. The string grows quickly, and looks like a ton of gibberish, but it ultimately creates the instructions for our little turtle that draws a cool looking plant or some geometric
                figure.</p>
            <p>Some things to note about this simulator: the starting point for the L-system will be at the bottom center of the canvas, unless you're drawing a geometric system or a FASS system (for those I had to figure out the beginning
                coordinates and inital line length through pure trial and error, so you're welcome). If you're entering your own L-system, keep in mind where it begins (maybe some day I'll come back and add the feature to choose your beginning point,
                but for now that's not happening, sorry). </p>
            <p> Oh, and by the way, FASS stands for space-filling, self-avoiding, simple, self-similar, if you were wondering.</p>
