            <p> Perlin noise is basically a really, reallllly bad random function (to put it simply). We all love the bell curve -- Perlin noise kind of mimicks that. A good random function would ideally have an even distribution, and Perlin noise
                does not. It focuses on the middle. We have Ken Pelrin to thank for this wonderful gradient noise (the reason this was invented was because of the movie TRON in a really good attempt to naturalize computer-generated images). tl;dr:
                Perlin noise is smoother than random as a function of time. </p>
            <p> So now bringing this back to this simulation (that's why you're here afterall). A 2D array (think like a grid) is made and each cell contains a vector, whose heading is determined by Perlin noise. That means that our little vectors
                are all going to smoothly transition from one row and column to the next, and over time they'll change directions. For optimization purposes, this array is created once per simulation (every time you change colors, restart the
                simulation, etc).</p>
            <p> Now we choose the number of particles we want to follow these vectors, for now we'll use the default of 500. For every single frame that is drawn to the screen we need to update the position of every. single. particle. We do this by
                getting the particles current position and finding the array cell closest to it, and then we apply this force to our particle to influence its direction. We then update the particles actual position with physics (velocity,
                acceleration, etc, all that gross stuff) and draw a line connecting our old position with our new. And we do that FOR EVERY SINGLE PARTICLE IN EACH FRAME so if you're choosing a high number of particles be patient, it's working hard.
