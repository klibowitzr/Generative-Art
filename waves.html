            <h2 id="work"> here's the secret</h2>
            <p>You have an array (collection of objects) that is filled with the number of lines you deemed appropirate above. These lines are created out of a collection of points that are spaced a certain distance apart (what you chose for step).
                We connect those points to create a line.
            </p>
            <p> But the thing is, that's not very fun or interesting. So instead, we go through the points and mess with them a little bit, moving them vertically by some random amount. We are focusing the most variance on the area that you chose
                (unless its even, then there isn't one area that's weighted over the others, or whoville, which was a happy accident that somehow reminded me of Dr. Seuss). There is a lot of random variables being called, which is why you get a
                different piece everytime. But (and this is important) you have to use Bezier curves so that these lines are smooth. If you don't, you'd get some ugly looking jagged lines.</p>

            <p> In order to add colors, we have to close this curve to make it a shape, so we do that by drawing along the ends of the canvas. Basically, each section is a boxy shape with a weird top, and we draw each new shape on top the others,
                giving the wavy mountain effect. </p>
